I was there, in this fight, and it was one hell of a day. I never post comments but I happened to be up late browsing hilarious comments on funker and what do ya know...our video made Funker! So since I was there, on the far side of that ditch and I've read tons of comments speculating on what was happening, some funny, some retarded...and I'm up late...I'll tell what happened. I haven't checked but maybe some of my buddies already did this...
We were dismounted, arrived in the village before dawn, looking for a guy. Didn't find him, exfiled a little after 8am (which was bad juju in that area...as you can see) and wedged out to move across this open area. Halfway across this giant field we took contact, seemed like it came from everywhere. So we hit the first bit of cover available... This small ass ditch. And we got lead rained down on us as we tried to get a fix on their position/s. Our video here is actually about ten minutes into the fight. We still weren't sure were it was coming from and that's when shit got interesting. 
A national Gaurd supply convoy came through our AO and did not battle track. Our battalion was not aware they were on the road therefore they nor us had their frequency to jump to and call a cease fire. These guys just rolled in blind. The rounds from beeb were whizzin over out heads as you can hear, and traveling on to the road that just luckily enough for us...the trucks were passing by (sarcasm). They assumed they had been engaged and doing what supply units are not taught to do...stopped their trucks, spun their turrets, and engaged what they saw...us in that ditch, bobbin up and down trying to figure out where the bad guys were. At about 300 meters...that's how far off the road we were...I guess we looked like Taliban to them (sarcasm). it's not funny cuz it sucked but...they lit us up so good the friggin Taliban broke contact shortly after. Guess they were like..."the national Gaurd will get'em for us lol" 
So to clear up the most common speculation I've read, no we didn't have comms issues, we just didn't have those retards frequency cuz they didn't battle track and it took a while to get anyone to believe that trucks were Layin into us. We thought it was our Charlie co at first since they were nearby...fog of war. Then when battalion realized we weren't all geeked out on hookers and blow and were actually being serious..(you have to understand..we are the battalions Recon platoon, we are known to conduct baffoonery on an epic scale) it took another piece of time to spin up C co to come out and get the national Gaurd trucks to knock it the hell off.

Also Yes, we had a JTAC and he was tossing smoke, yelling into his own net, and cursing in every direction...and yes we were shootin flares and yes we were on the net with battalion yelling our heads off. It took them a minute to even believe us that trucks were lighting us up! That convoy was just a bunch of idiots trying to earn their CABs...they did a million things wrong and yes we hate them and yes they saw the smoke and the flares and still didn't think that it's ridiculous for anyone to mark their own position with smoke and flares...but they said fuck it and kept shootin and etc etc. they were reporting to their higher that they had killed several Taliban and wounded several others! 

Those weekend d bags killed NO ONE, but our beloved platoon sarg was shot through both arms. Not saying those Gaurd turds shot him...don't want to give them credit for having any accuracy whatsoever...but we didn't take wounded till they showed up...with 14 trucks and crew serves...just sayin. He is the definition of professional mother fucker and we did some major ass kicking with him over there...fuckin major. We were NOT happy that he was hurt and got sent home. Missed him everyday. And poor Kinney busted up his ankle scrambling for the ditch with all the AG gear on his back. Lol sounds terrible but it was kinda funny at the time...you gotta walk a long way as an AG to get the irony of having the heaviest kit in the platoon and now a busted ankle to try to move on, and getting lit up from all over..shit sandwich. He toughed it up though and returned fire like a boss...until the trucks showed up...then we all just got real small and said fuck a lot.
